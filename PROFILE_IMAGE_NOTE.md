# Profile Image Setup for Grishma Mahorkar's Portfolio

## Current Status
The portfolio is set up with a placeholder reference to `grishma-profile.jpg` in the hero section.

## To Add Grishma's Actual Photo:

1. **Obtain a high-quality photo of Grishma Mahorkar**
   - Preferably a professional headshot
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1) works best
   - Minimum resolution: 500x500 pixels
   - Maximum file size: 2MB for web optimization

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Clear, well-lit photo
   - Professional appearance
   - Neutral or tech-related background

3. **File Placement:**
   - Save the image as `grishma-profile.jpg` in the root directory
   - This will automatically replace the placeholder reference

4. **Alternative Naming:**
   If using a different filename, update the image source in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <img src="your-image-filename.jpg" alt="Grishma Mahorkar" class="profile-image">
   ```

## Image Optimization Tips:
- Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh.app to compress the image
- Consider WebP format for better compression
- Ensure the image looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
- Test the image on different screen sizes

## Fallback Options:
If no photo is available, consider:
- A professional avatar/illustration
- A stylized geometric representation
- A logo/initials design
- Keep the current CSS styling that creates an elegant placeholder

The portfolio's CSS already includes beautiful styling for the profile image with:
- Circular border with gradient
- Hover animations
- 3D tilt effects
- Rotating border animation

Once the image is added, these effects will enhance the visual appeal significantly.
